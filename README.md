# Volkan Özdemir

I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student.  
I focus on embedded systems, ESP32-based projects, and
hardware–software integration.

This repository contains **small-scale projects developed during my learning process**.  
My main and more comprehensive projects are shared in separate repositories.
